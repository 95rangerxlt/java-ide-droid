This is how to use Ant on Android (needs JavaIDEdroid PRO):
  # Get JavaIDEdroid v2.6.0 or later from Google Play
  # Get ant_1-9-1.jar.dex.zip from the Download area and copy it to the storage card of your Android device
  # Get ecj_ant-adapter_3-8-3.jar.dex.zip from Download area and copy it to the storage card of your Android device
