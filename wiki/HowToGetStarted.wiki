#summary This is how you get started with JavaIDEdroid
#labels Featured

  # Get the latest version of JavaIDEdroid from the Android Market and install it
  # Download and install a file manager like ASTRO
  # Download and install a text editor like !TextWarrior or Jota
  # Download !HelloAndroid and unzip it to a directory of your choice
  # Download the Android SDK, extract the android.jar for your platform and put it on the storage card of your device. You need android.jar for the aapt and compilation tasks. You can also get some android.jar from the download area
  # Start JavaIDEdroid, choose 'Options' in the menu and set the android.jar path to where you copied it, for example /mnt/sdcard/AndroidSDK/android.jar
  # Read the built-in help, even if you never read manuals :-)
  # If you are new to Android development, you might want to download 'Android Development Basics', a free App tutorial about Android development

<BR/>Build the !HelloAndroid.APK with the scripts started in the !BeanShell tab of JavaIDEdroid:
  # Run 1_aapt.bsh to create R.java and !HelloAndroid.apk.res
  # Run 2_compile-main.bsh to compile the Java sources.
  # Run 3_dx.bsh to create the classes.dex file
  # Run 4_apkbuilder.bsh to create the unsigned APK file. Signing with apkbuilder does *not* work, because a lot of proprietary Sun classes are called.
  # Run 5_signjar.bsh to create the final signed APK.
  # Install the APK with a Package Manager like ASTRO or Linda Manager and test the !HelloAndroid app.

Alternatively, you can run 0_build.bsh which performs the above tasks all at once. On errors, the 0_build.bsh stops and does not do any following tasks.

<b>Make sure you save your files in ANSI (iso-8859-1 / latin-1 / win1252) format!</b> For XML files I recommend to also use iso-8859-1 encoding and specify this at the beginning of the files.
