#summary This is how you get started with JavaIDEdroid
#labels Featured

  # Get the latest version of JavaIDEdroid from the Android Market and install it
  # Download !HelloAndroid and unzip it to a directory of your choice
  # Download the Android SDK and extract the android.jar for your platform. You need android.jar for the compilation task. You can also get the android.jar (for API 8 = Android 2.2) from the JavaIDEdroid download area
  # Adjust where needed the paths in all .bsh files in the toplevel directory of !HelloAndroid


<BR/>Build the !HelloAndroid.APK with the scripts started in the !BeanShell tab of JavaIDEdroid:
  # Run 1_aapt.bsh to create R.java and !HelloAndroid.apk.res
  # Run 2_compile-main.bsh to compile the Java sources.
  # Run 3_dx.bsh to create the classes.dex file
  # Run 4_apkbuilder.bsh to create the unsigned APK file. Signing with apkbuilder does *not* work, because a lot of proprietary Sun classes are called.
  # Run 5_signjar.bsh to create the final signed APK.
  # Install the APK with a Package Manager like ASTRO or Linda Manager and test the !HelloAndroid app.

Alternatively, you can run 0_build.bsh which performs the above tasks all at once. On errors, the 0_build.bsh stops and does not do any following tasks.
