  # Dowload and install the latest version of JavaIDEdroid
  # Download HelloAndroid
  # Adjust where needed the paths in *.bat and *.bsh in the toplevel directory of HelloAndroid
  # Run 0_aapt.bat on your *desktop* machine. This creates the R.java and HelloAndroid.apk.res files. <br>
The rest of the build process can now be done on Android device with scripts started in the BeanShell tab of JavaIDEdroid.
  # Run 2_compile-main.bsh to compile the Java sources.
  # Run 3_dx.bsh to create the classes.dex file
  # Run 4_apkbuilder.bsh to create the unsigned APK file. Signing with apkbuilder does *not* work, because a lot of proprierty Sun classes are called.
  # Run 5_signjar.bsh to create the final signed APK.
  # Install the APK with a Package Manager like ASTRO or Linda Manager and test the HelloAndroid app.
