#summary How to develop CN1 apps on Android devices
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

!CodeNameOne (CN1) development normally is done on the PC using Eclipse, !NetBeans or IntelliJ with the !CodeNameOne plugin. 

But now, you can also develop CN1 apps on an Android device! 
<br>This wiki explains how this is done.


= Details =

*What is working on Android ?*
  * Editing CN1 source code: Use any text editor or any IDE (e.g. AIDE)
  * Building CN1 projects: !JavaRunner feature of JavaIDEdroid
  * Sending CN1 builds to the CN1 build Server: !JavaRunner feature of JavaIDEdroid
  * Downloading and testing the builds: Web Browser, built-in package manager

*What is not (yet) working on Android ?*
  * CN1 Designer
  * CN1 Simulator

*How to work around the limitations:*<br>
For the Simulator, unfortunately, there is no good alternative. Of course, you can use your Android development device to test a build, but for this you need to go through the build servers and then, you can only test the Android platform.

With Designer, you create binary resource files which handle following things:
  # Themes
  # Images
  # Data files
  # GUIs
  # Localization

The current solution to Point 1 to 3 is to still use the binary src/theme.res file which you will still need to create on the PC. But since you don't need to change these things very often, you can work most of the time without your PC.

For creating GUIs there is Steve Hannah's [http://sjhannah.com/blog/?p=345 CN1ML Parser] which will use cn1ml files to create GUIs in Java source code. cn1ml files are HTML files with additional CN1ML elements.

For Localization, you can use the standard res/theme.xml along with the utility class com.t_arn.lib.ui.util.taResources which offers the same localization interface as com.codename1.ui.util.Resources

*More information on how to set up the CN1 tool chain on Android and how to use it will follow shortly, along with a demo project.*
