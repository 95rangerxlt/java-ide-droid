#summary How to develop CN1 apps on Android devices
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

!CodenameOne (CN1) development normally is done on the deskop computer using Eclipse, !NetBeans or IntelliJ with the !CodenameOne plugin. 

But now, you can also develop CN1 apps on an Android device! 


= Details =
== Motivation ==
Why would you want to develop on Android devices?<br>
For me, Android tablets are better portable development devices than Windows based Notebooks because:
  * I especially like the instant ON / OFF feature on Android. Since apps are designed for this, you'll more likely not loose data due to instant OFF (for example, when I have to run off a train or bus at a stop)
  * The battery runtime is longer on Android
  * The performance of light Windows tablets is normally not so great, especially when you run applications that are meant to run on high-performance desktops
  * Android tablets are cheaper
  * With an Android tablet you can test your builds right on the real device

And, of course, I like to drive JavaIDEdroid to its limits :-)


== So, what is working on Android ? ==
  * Editing CN1 source code: Use any text editor or any IDE (e.g. AIDE)
  * Building CN1 projects: !JavaRunner feature of JavaIDEdroid
  * Sending CN1 builds to the CN1 build server: !JavaRunner feature of JavaIDEdroid
  * Downloading and testing the builds: Web Browser, built-in package manager

== What is not (yet) working on Android ? ==
  * CN1 Simulator
  * CN1 Designer

== How to work around the limitations: ==
For the *Simulator*, unfortunately, there is no fully equivalent alternative. Of course, you can use your Android development device to create a build (even offline!) and test the build. You have the real device to test, but you can only test the Android platform. There's no way to test the other platforms like iPhone or Windows Phone.

With *Designer*, you create binary resource files which handle following things:
  # Themes
  # Images
  # Fonts
  # Data files
  # GUIs
  # Localization

The current solution to Point 1 to 3 is to still use the binary src/theme.res file which you will still need to create on the desktop computer. But since you don't need to change these things very often, you can work most of the time without your desktop computer.

For *creating GUIs* there is Steve Hannah's [http://sjhannah.com/blog/?p=345 CN1ML Parser] which will use cn1ml files to create GUIs in Java source code. cn1ml files are HTML files with additional CN1ML elements.

For *Localization* and *data files*, you can use the standard res/theme.xml along with the utility class com.t_arn.lib.ui.util.taResources which offers the same interface as com.codename1.ui.util.Resources

*More information on how to set up the CN1 tool chain on Android and how to use it will follow shortly, along with a demo project.*
